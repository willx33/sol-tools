# Future Architecture for Sol-Tools

## Web-Based Architecture (Proposed Migration)

This document outlines a proposed migration from the current CLI-based architecture to a modern web-based solution for Sol-Tools. This approach addresses current limitations while preserving valuable analysis capabilities.

## Hybrid Architecture

### Frontend
- **React + TypeScript**: Modern, responsive UI
- **Features**:
  - Interactive blockchain data visualizations
  - Real-time transaction monitoring
  - Tabular data with sorting/filtering capabilities
  - Multiple concurrent analysis workflows
  - Improved UX for data exploration
  - Shareable reports and analysis

### Backend
- **Python/FastAPI**: Leverage existing data analysis code
- **Features**:
  - Retain Python data analysis capabilities (pandas, numpy)
  - Excel/CSV processing and exports
  - Statistical calculations
  - Type-safe API with Pydantic models
  - Auto-generated TypeScript types for frontend

## Key Benefits

1. **Superior User Experience**:
   - Visualization options impossible in CLI (charts, graphs)
   - More intuitive data exploration
   - More readable transaction and wallet data
   - Responsive design works on various devices

2. **Developer Experience**:
   - Retain valuable Python analysis code
   - Better TypeScript tooling for blockchain interactions
   - Cleaner architecture with separation of concerns
   - Easier maintenance and feature additions

3. **Performance**:
   - Offload heavy computation to backend
   - More responsive UI with optimistic updates
   - Better caching possibilities
   - Parallel processing where appropriate

## Migration Strategy

1. **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure**
   - Set up FastAPI backend with key endpoints
   - Create basic React frontend with auth and navigation
   - Establish type generation pipeline

2. **Phase 2: Modular Migration**
   - Migrate one module at a time, starting with most valuable features
   - Build dedicated UI components for each analysis type
   - Implement data visualization for key metrics

3. **Phase 3: Enhanced Features**
   - Add features impossible in CLI (saved sessions, sharing)
   - Implement real-time monitoring with websockets
   - Add offline capabilities
   - Improve cross-chain analysis visualization

## Deployment Options

1. **Local Development App**:
   - Desktop application using Tauri or Electron
   - Run locally with bundled backend
   - Access to file system for data import/export

2. **Self-Hosted Web Application**:
   - Deploy to private server
   - Multi-user support
   - Centralized data collection

3. **Hybrid Approach**:
   - Core features in desktop app
   - Optional cloud synchronization
   - Shared dashboards for team analysis

## Technical Considerations

1. **Data Privacy**: Keep sensitive wallet data local when needed
2. **API Rate Limiting**: Smart caching to avoid blockchain API limits
3. **Offline Support**: Allow analysis of previously downloaded data
4. **Security**: Proper API auth for any remote deployment

## Next Steps

1. Create proof-of-concept with core Solana analysis features
2. Benchmark performance compared to CLI version
3. Validate UX improvements with test users
4. Develop migration timeline for all modules
